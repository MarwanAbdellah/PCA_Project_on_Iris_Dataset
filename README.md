# PCA Project on Iris Dataset

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in the field of machine learning. The goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of its variance, making it easier to visualize and analyze.

## Dataset
- **Name**: Iris Dataset
- **Description**: The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a target variable representing the flower species (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica).
- **Source**: This dataset is available in the `sklearn.datasets` module.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris`.
2. **Preprocessing**: Standardization of the features is performed to ensure that PCA can identify the principal components effectively.
3. **PCA Application**: PCA is applied to reduce the dataset to 2 or 3 principal components for visualization and analysis.
4. **Visualization**: The transformed data is plotted to observe how well PCA separates the classes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to explore the PCA process.

## Results
The PCA transformation helps in visualizing the separation between different species of iris flowers based on reduced dimensions, providing insights into the underlying structure of the dataset.
